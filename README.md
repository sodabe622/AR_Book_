Author: Sodabe Bandali

Course: CS , Spring 2024

This project involves the development of an augmented reality (AR) version of a book cover, incorporating both augmented text and imagery. Utilizing the Vuforia Engine SDK within Unity, this effort resulted in the creation of AR adaptations for both the front and back covers of the "Software Engineering" book.

For the front cover, augmented reality technology overlays the book's title and author's name against a black backdrop, which conceals the original cover. This scene is

The reverse side of the book offers a summary and other pertinent details, alongside a virtual button. This button allows users to switch between the book's information and a concise critique. Interaction with the button is enabled by touching the book's lower middle section. The project assets, including images of the original book covers, are archived in the Media directory.

Instructional Resources:
--------------------------------
-Developing image targets via the Vuforia Developer Portal.

-Creating a virtual button feature.

-Embedding augmented text onto an image target.

-Generating 3D animated character models with Adobe Mixamo.

File Storage:
----------------------------------------------
Several files, due to their size, are hosted using GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS), including:

Vuforia Engine SDK package
